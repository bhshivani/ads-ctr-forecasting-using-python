# Ads CTR Analysis and Forecasting

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of advertisements. CTR measures the effectiveness of online advertisements by tracking the percentage of ad impressions that result in user clicks. By examining past performance, we can use time series forecasting to predict future CTR values, helping businesses optimize their advertising ROI.

## Project Objectives
1. **CTR Analysis**: Examine the effectiveness of ad campaigns by analyzing impressions and clicks data.
2. **Forecasting CTR**: Use time series models to predict future CTR, assisting in informed decision-making for ad budgets and strategies.

## Workflow and Methodology
### 1. Data Collection
   - We use a sample dataset that includes daily ad impression and click counts.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - **CTR Calculation**: CTR is calculated as `(Clicks / Impressions) * 100`.
   - **Visualization**: Visualizations, such as line charts for clicks and impressions and scatter plots for CTR, are created to understand trends and relationships.
   - **Trend Analysis**: Analysis of CTR by day of the week, comparison of weekday vs. weekend performance, and CTR distribution.

### 3. Time Series Analysis
   - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and noise components.
   - Use Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) and Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF) to identify SARIMA model parameters.

### 4. Model Building and Forecasting
   - **Model Selection**: SARIMA model is chosen based on time series properties.
   - **Model Training**: Model is trained on historical CTR data.
   - **Prediction**: Forecasts future CTR values, which are plotted alongside historical data for comparison.

## Results
- **CTR Trends**: Clear patterns in CTR are observed over weekdays and weekends.
- **CTR Forecast**: Forecasted CTR values provide insights for future ad performance and help optimize ad spending strategies.

## Code Overview
- **`data_preparation.py`**: Loads and preprocesses the data for analysis.
- **`eda_visualization.py`**: Generates visualizations to understand data trends.
- **`ctr_forecasting.py`**: Implements the SARIMA model for forecasting future CTR values.
- **`plot_forecast.py`**: Creates plots for both historical and forecasted CTR values.

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas plotly statsmodels matplotlib
```

### Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ads-ctr-analysis-forecasting.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ads-ctr-analysis-forecasting
   ```
3. Run each Python script in the recommended order for a full analysis and forecasting workflow:
   ```bash
   python data_preparation.py
   python eda_visualization.py
   python ctr_forecasting.py
   python plot_forecast.py
   ```

## Conclusion
CTR Analysis and Forecasting provides valuable insights into ad effectiveness, aiding businesses in making data-driven advertising decisions. This project demonstrates how to implement CTR analysis, EDA, and time series forecasting using Python.
